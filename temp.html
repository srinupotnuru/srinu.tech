                    Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant
                    parents who undertook the arduous journey to the shores of
                    America with the intention of giving their children the best
                    future. His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the
                    tastiest dishes with whatever is available inexpensively at
                    the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the
                    fusion cuisines for which
                    <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his
                    zeal for fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering
                    cross-cultural culinary connections.

                    Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his
                    colleagues, comes from a long established family tradition in
                    farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the
                    Australian outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of
                    food sources. As he puts it in his own words,
                    <em>Everything that runs, wins, and everything that stays,

                    Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our
                    CTO, personally ensures that every dish that we serve meets his
                    exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues
                    if their dish does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by
                    his motto,
